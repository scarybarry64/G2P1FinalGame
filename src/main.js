//Game Name: CyberSplice
//Completed: 5/3/2020
//Creative Tilt: Vision mechanic that reveals hidden obstacles and old-school
//terminal style color palette. Along with this the screen shaking when the
//player uses their ground slam ability and particle effects on despawning
//obstacles were favorite design choices of the team. The art team is especially
//proud of the player sprite and eye sprites, which were made from scratch.
//Lastly, the tutorial is a playable scene with prompts that only progress
//when the player presses the correct button. This, the sight mechanic, the
//screen shaking, and the particle effects were technically challenging but
//proved rewarding. The custom player and eye sprites, and old-school
//black/neon-green Matrix-esque aesthetic give the game a fresh if not
//interesting visual style that fits within the skillset of a team of
//programmers (which we are).
